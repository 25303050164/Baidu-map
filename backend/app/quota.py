"""Per-service quota: separate gates, task buckets and a durable daily ledger.

The two Baidu services are separate pools, so they get separate gates; a route
attempt and a place attempt never consume each other's allowance. Pacing itself
is the existing response-paced ``RateGate`` — this module adds what it does not
own: the per-task buckets, the application-wide daily budget and the tier that
applies right now.

An attempt checks allowances, acquires the service slot within its deadline,
waits for response-paced scheduling, then reserves the daily and task budgets.
Queue expiry does not consume a request; dispatched failures remain counted.
Reserving happens *before* the request is sent,
so failed, retried and sent-but-unclear attempts all stay counted and a process
restart never clears the ledger. The day boundary is Asia/Shanghai.

The ledger is a "this application" budget. The browser SDK, other applications
and the console's own accounting sit outside it, so a remaining balance here is
never a claim about the account's real remaining allowance.

The pools are the outer scheduler: a transport wrapper asks its pool for the
attempt and must not also pace on the service's gate, which would pace twice and
deadlock on the shared in-flight lock.

Every walking-route request of the application -- both boundary engines, the
legacy ``/api/analyses`` and ``/api/v1/analysis/hybrid`` endpoints, verification
and click-detail routes -- paces on the one direction gate, and every place
search on the one place gate. Each gate reads the active tier when it waits, so a
tier switch lowers every caller at once and two limiters can never add up on one
key. The engines and legacy endpoints pace on the gate directly (their own
budgets bound them), so only the stages that reserve through a pool appear in
the daily ledger; the balance below says so.
