"""§4.2's first round, planned once so a precheck and the run cannot disagree.

A precheck that answers "may this retrieval start, and does it have to go to the
network at all?" has to count the pages the run will really ask for, under the
keys the cache really uses. This module derives both from the planner itself —
the same ``coarse_blocks`` extent, the same rotation, the same category
vocabulary, the same ``page_key`` — instead of restating them approximately. It
*constructs* the planner and reads the round it planned; it never runs it, sends
nothing, reserves nothing and touches no cache entry's data time.

Two limits are stated rather than implied, because both are easy to overread:

* Only each category's primary keyword is planned. Later keywords, paging and
  subdivision cost more, so an affordable first round is not a promise that the
  retrieval finishes.
* A page counted as reusable is one a read-only lookup can answer *now*. An
  identical in-flight request is not one: it has not succeeded yet, so it is
  never netted off the estimate. Execution may still get it for free, which can
  only make the real cost smaller than what was checked here.
