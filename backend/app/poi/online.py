"""§4.2 adaptive online planning: coarse blocks, rotation, subdivision, evidence.

The fixed 4×4 plan in ``planner.py`` spends 96 requests on its first round and
cannot fit the standard 60-attempt online budget. This module plans the same
``around`` search adaptively instead: it starts from the query domain's envelope
split 2×2, keeps the blocks that intersect the domain, and spends its budget in a
rotation across categories so that no category is exhausted first.

A page is the unit of scheduling. ``fetch`` is injected and must perform exactly
one upstream attempt per call: pacing, the service's single in-flight slot and
the daily reservation belong to the quota pool that wraps it (§9), while retry
policy belongs here, because §4.2.5 makes paging, subdivision and retry share
one budget.

The run reports raw rows with the request that produced them. The caller
normalizes them and then clips with ``clip_to_domain``: a block is searched with
its circumscribed circle, which reaches past the domain, and only the domain's
part is a facility finding.

Incomplete evidence is never discarded and never rounded up. A truncated or
unstable block is subdivided and queried again with smaller circles when it can
still be subdivided; when it cannot — the finest block still saturated, the
budget gone, a query failed — the coverage says so and the run stays ``partial``.
Finishing a keyword search is not evidence that the real directory is complete,
so this module cannot express a completeness claim at all: the only value it can
report is ``unverified`` (§4.2).

Two ceilings, never one. What a run may spend on *new network calls* belongs to
the task bucket and the daily ledger, which refuse atomically at the moment of
dispatch; what it may spend on *local scheduling* — cached replays, subdivision,
retries — is bounded here, by :data:`PROCESSING_STEP_LIMIT`. Collapsing them was
the bug this module now avoids: a replay of a page the cache already holds costs
no allowance, so counting it against the paid budget stopped a second retrieval at
the very boundary the first one reached, and a run that had spent its allowance
threw away the pages the cache could still answer. A caller that names only
``budget`` keeps the single ceiling it has always been promised
(:func:`legacy_limits`); one that brings :class:`RunLimits` says the two apart.
