"""§4.2–§4.4: one facility retrieval over the computed boundary.

The pieces already exist and are only composed here: the adaptive planner
chooses the queries, the place session meters them, the cache sits outside the
quota pool, and the POI pipeline normalizes, classifies and merges what comes
back. What this module adds is the composition and the reporting.

Three properties are the point of it:

* **The counting region is the boundary.** Rows are clipped to the query range
  (an ``around`` search is a superset) and then counted where the computed
  boundary says they are, not where the search range does. A facility just
  outside the boundary is kept as evidence, never as a finding.
* **Failure is never a zero.** A page that failed, a stage that could not build a
  transport or a boundary that is no region all leave a named reason; an empty
  group is only ever the result of a run that actually happened.
* **The two quality axes stay apart.** ``queryStatus`` says what the queries
  established, ``catalogCompleteness`` is ``unverified`` because a keyword search
  cannot verify a real directory — no count here is a completeness claim.
