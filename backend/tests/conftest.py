    ``Settings`` names the paths a real deployment uses, so a test that writes
    ``Settings(_env_file=None, ...)`` without overriding them aims its ledger at
    ``backend/.quota/quota.sqlite3`` and its checkup store at ``backend/.checkups``.
    Constructing them is enough to create the schema, and a test that reserved an
    attempt would spend the deployment's own day — the accounting this suite exists
    to protect. A test is about behaviour, not about which directory the deployment
    happens to use.

    Two limits keep the redirect honest:

    * Only a construction that *asks* for an explicit configuration is redirected,
      and a path the test itself passes always wins, so a test that means to point
      somewhere specific still does.
    * ``load_settings()`` is untouched. A test that calls it is asking about the
      ambient deployment configuration, and must keep getting the real answer.
