"""§5–§7.2 端到端：成圈 → 设施 → 服务覆盖 → 灰区 → 评分 → 报告 → 图层。

The facility transport is the synthetic one from ``test_checkup_facilities``, so
the run issues no HTTP; the walking network is a synthetic road grid installed
at the seam production resolves the OSM graph through
(``app.state.checkups.offline``). What is under test is the whole chain a reader
of the report depends on:

* the four stages publish in order and the last one is the report;
* A is frozen before it is divided, and C + G + U equals it for every category;
* a category with no facility is *unknown*, not 0% covered;
* every grey zone can answer what is missing, how big it is, why, and what to
  check next — and the layer drawn on the map is the same object that was
  counted, not a second reconstruction of it;
* the report pins the digest of the revision it summarises rather than its own,
  and carries the limitations it is not allowed to leave out.
