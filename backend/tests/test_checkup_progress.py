"""A running task reports what it is doing, on one clock, while it is doing it.

The status endpoint is what a client polls for the whole life of a task. These
cases pin down what it may be trusted for: the elapsed time is measured on the
same wall clock the store writes; a stage that lasts minutes still publishes
the step it is in and the counts that have really moved; a stretch with nothing
new stays silent rather than being papered over; and the endpoint keeps
answering while the worker is blocked inside a stage. Everything runs offline.
